    we decided to work on Quantum Exhibit. We wanted to display interesting physics simulations while also explaining the math and concepts behind\
    such topics. We hope to inspire the next generation of students to learn and create their own simulations.",

    been dipping my feet into the world of full stack development. Building creative and unique websites has allowed my \
    artistic side to flow out. Being able to create these physics simulations has allowed me to understand the physics \
    at a deeper level while also having fun and spreading the knowledge of physics. It has also allowed me to hone my \
    full stack development skills. I have worked with multiple technologies including MERN, VueJS, NodeJS, Golang, \
    Typescript, and many other that I've picked up while working at the Department of National Defence as a Full Stack developer.",

    Developing physics simulations and this site has let me explore my interest in physics in non-traditional ways\
    enabling me to pursue and merge my passion for writing, coding and physics on my own terms. I have experience working in a number of scientific\
    research institutes such as TRIUMF and SNOLAB and have developed experience working with Monte Carlo simulations and Statistical Data Analysis\
    techniques in ROOT, Python C++ and even Fortran. Working on experiments ranging from Dark Matter experiments (Deap-3600 and DarkSide-20K) to\
    Nuclear Physics and Magneto-Optical Atom Traps (TRINAT) has allowed me to learn about a wide range of physics sub-fields, a list I hope to\
    keep growing",
